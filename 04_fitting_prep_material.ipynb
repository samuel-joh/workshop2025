You have to recreate these time series by adjusting the model parameters G (the coupling parameter) in Model A and Omega (the instrinsic frequency) in Model B. Your goal is to choose the model parameter of both Model A and B in such a way that the time series that you create look as close as possible to the ones you are provided with. The process to find the parameters that were used to generate artificial data is called parameter recovery.\n",

Please first find your own solution and write it down and then compare it with the others and write down the adapted solution after the discussion. In A and B, since there are only two nodes, you can guess the best parameter based on how similar your simulated timeseries are to the empirical ones. In C you should try to fit the resulting functional connectivity matrix.\n",
