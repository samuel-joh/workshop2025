        "**Biophysical Models**\n",
        "\n",
        "Biophysical modeling is an approach that aims to capture the biological details of neural populations. This means that biophysical models are grounded in the biophysical properties of neurons, such as ion channel dynamics, neurotransmitter kinetics, and synaptic plasticity. Biophysical models often incorporate detailed representations of biological entities, such as conductances, which correspond to the flow of ions across neuronal membranes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phenomenological Models**\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast to biophysical modeling, phenomenological modeling takes a more abstract and high-level approach. Instead of focusing on the detailed biophysical mechanisms, phenomenological models aim to capture the qualitative behavior and emergent properties of neural systems. This means that we have recordings of empirical data and we have some mathematical equations that try to capture these recordings as best as possible. These models often use mathematical frameworks and computational techniques to describe and simulate the observed phenomena without necessarily incorporating the underlying biological details.\n",
        "\n",
        "*E.g., You can approximate the hourly temperature over the course of a month with a sinusoidal wave, where the temperature will be higher during the day and lower during the night. You have no idea why, but this still allows you to understand some things (like maybe you have higher excursion between day and night in a place i.e., the desert, compared to another). Here, our model provides a mathematical description of the observed phenomenon (periodic temperature changes) without explaining the reasons behind it, such as the Earth's rotation, atmospheric dynamics, or thermodynamics.*\n",
        "\n",
        "Another good example to understand these models is the study of bird flocks (see video). For example, in the video you can see how each bird moves on its own, but also the flock itself shows some collective movement. Phenomenologically, we could study for example the centroid of the bird flock and its dispersion and this would give us many insights regarding the collective behavior of these animals.\n",

        "The strength of biophysical modeling lies in its ability to provide a mechanistic understanding of neural processes by directly linking them to the underlying biological components. These models can help researchers explore how specific biophysical parameters influence neural behavior and test hypotheses about the role of different cellular and molecular mechanisms in shaping neural activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons of biophysical models**:\n",
        "The main downside of these models is that the more biological realism comes with a higher number of coupled differential equations to be solved, up to ~thousands for each neuron (e.g., each type of ion channel should have its own equation, then equations for ion channels on dendrites are different depending on the morphology, and so on). Even with massive computing power and parallelism, this currently poses severe technical limitations on the number of neurons we can simulate at the highest level of biological realism (currently ~ some squared cm). Nonetheless we can use simplified models where we describe with just a couple of differential equations the activity of ~millions of neurons, allowing us to simulate whole-brain activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pros of phenomenological models**:\n",
        "Phenomenological models are particularly useful when the precise biological mechanisms are not well understood or when the goal is to study the collective behavior of large-scale neural networks. These models can provide insights into the computational principles and information processing capabilities of neural systems, without being constrained by the complexities of biological details. This allows to run several modeling simulations at a large-scale in many individuals, which is currently much more computationally expensive with biophysically detailed models\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons of phenomenological models**:\n",
        "Being phenomenological, these models do not allow us to delve into the molecular, biophysical and cellular mechanisms. This is a great limitation if you want to know exactly what to change in order to achieve a particular state and how to do it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "While biophysical and phenomenological modeling approaches may seem distinct, they are often complementary in computational neuroscience and many models share some degree of both approaches. Biophysical models can inform and constrain phenomenological models by providing a biological foundation and validating the assumptions made in the abstract models. Conversely, phenomenological models can guide the development of biophysical models by identifying relevant phenomena and suggesting potential mechanisms to be explored."

        "This Bonus will explore a phenomenological non-linear model of coupled oscillators knowns as the **Stuart-Landau model**, commonly referred to in the neuroscience context as the **Hopf model** (more precisely as the *normal form of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation*). This model is a canonical model to study systems of coupled oscillators for which both the phase and the amplitude interact. In this model, as nonlinearities increase, isolated nodes transit through two qualitatively different dynamics: from damped oscillations to self-sustained oscillations. Today we will focus on these dynamics. The dynamics of a single uncoupled node $i$ is given by the following differential equation, with complex variable $z$ as the state variable:\n",
