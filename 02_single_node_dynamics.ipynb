        "A possible way to simulate the activity of the brain over time is to use **whole-brain models**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whole-brain models encompass a collection of equations that depict the dynamics and interplay among neural populations across various brain regions. In simpler terms, you divide the brain in different regions (remember the parcellations of different colors from the previous lecture) and simulate the activity of each region over time using a differential equation (for those that don't have a maths background, don't be scared, we won't dive into the details). These equations can be either formulated based on an understanding of the biophysical mechanisms that underlie diverse brain activities (biophysical models, e.g., based on specific assumptions like neuronal membrane conductance), or they can be chosen based on the dynamics they generate (phenomenological models, they describe what we see pretty well, even though they don't arise from biological variables). We will dive further into the differences later on.\n",
        "The local dynamics between different regions are then combined with estimates of anatomical connectivity networks obtained from in vivo measurements (via the structural connectivity matrix we discussed in the previous lecture).\n",
        "\n",
        "Most whole-brain models thus consist of three fundamental components:\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Local dynamics:* The activity of each brain region is typically determined by the selected local dynamics along with interaction terms involving other regions (e.g non-linear oscillators, neural field theory, neural mass models, etc.). As previously stated, the spatial scale is a limiting factor. If you were to simulate each neuron, you would have approximately 86 billions equations + 100 trillions of connection (this is if you summarize each neuron with just one free variable)... This is not achievable in real life, so if we want to simulate the whole brain we need to compromise on spatial scale. What we can do is simplify the activity of hundreds of millions of neurons (those composing each of our ROIs, see next) with just one (or a few) simple equation. So each of our regions will be in the order of 5-10 cm^2.\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Brain parcellation:* A brain parcellation determines the number of regions and the spatial resolution at which the brain dynamics occur. This parcellation may include cortical, sub-cortical, and cerebellar regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Anatomical connectivity matrix:* This matrix defines the network of connections between brain regions. Many studies rely on the human connectome, which is derived by estimating the number of white-matter fibers connecting different brain areas using DTI data combined with probabilistic tractography.\n",
